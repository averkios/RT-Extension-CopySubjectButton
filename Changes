Revision history for RT-Extension-CopySubjectButton

0.06 2024-1-18
 - Apparently the previous version only works on my machine, this version should fix that.

0.05 2023-12-29
 - Complete rewrite. The extension now uses the SubjectTag instead of the Queue name to generate the subject. This allows to have different Queue tags than the Queue name.
